# BankApplication-MyBranch
This is a very basic "Banking" application, without actual banking feature 

other than simple arithmatic operations between instances of the same class ("Account").

Made by using Spring Security framework + JDBC + Thymeleaf.



A personal continuation of the collaborated project with other teammates.

The original final practical project during the Java developer course I've participated has not "completely completed".

Therefore, here I will try to continue modifying and developing the unfinished application on my own for training purpose.

Thanks.
